* Support SWRL rules [2/7]

This branch is design to support SWRL rules, using Solution 3 from the
RFC branch.

 - [X] Rename Axiom to Component
 - [X] Rename AnnotatedAxiom to AnnotatedComponent
 - [ ] Move OntologyID to be AnnotatedComponent
 - [ ] What about doc_iri
 - [ ] Add is_axiom, is_id methods, macro'd out
 - [ ] Add SwrlRule (or SwrlComponent or equivalent)
 - [ ] Implement SwrlRule model
 - [ ] Update parsers



* Rename Axiom to Component [1/2]

 - [X] Change enum Axiom, struct AnnotatedAxiom
 - [ ] check instances of `axiom` as variable

* doc_iri

As far as I can see, I don't use the doc_iri support anywhere, and
certainly don't pass it between iterators. So, if we move them to
Component this will actually work
