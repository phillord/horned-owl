These are a series of test files in various OWL syntaxes.

The files in all the owl-* directories are auto-generated from the
bubo directory using the Tawny Bubo
(https://github.com/phillord/tawny-bubo) with associated .clj files
defining the ontology.

To regenerate all files use "make" in either this directory or the
bubo directory.

Autogenerated files are added to the git repository for simplicity.


There are a number of additional files in the directory `manual` which have been
generated in other ways. Most of these are by hand, when a test needs
to be broken or where the OWL API will not generate the file.

Finally, `family` and `family-other` are generated by
https://github.com/phillord/owl-primer.
